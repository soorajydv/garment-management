# S & S Textiles: Factory OS

Order, production, billing and delivery management for a sportswear (jersey/kit) factory.

- **frontend/**: Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript)
- **backend/**: Node.js + Express 5 + MongoDB (Mongoose 9) + TypeScript

See **[MVP.md](MVP.md)** for the MVP goal, what's included, and the roadmap.

## Quick start (no MongoDB install needed)

Needs Node.js 20+.

```bash
# Terminal 1: API on http://localhost:4000 with an in-memory MongoDB + demo data
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev:memory

# Terminal 2: web app on http://localhost:3000
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and use one of the demo buttons on the sign-in page.
Every demo account uses the password **`Password@123`**:

| Role | Email |
|---|---|
| Owner / Admin | owner@sstextiles.com |
| Designer | design@sstextiles.com |
| Printing | printing@sstextiles.com |
| Stitching | stitching@sstextiles.com |
| Finishing | finishing@sstextiles.com |
| Accounts | accounts@sstextiles.com |
| Customer (Himalayan Tigers FC) | tigers@himalayantigers.com |

> `dev:memory` data is lost when the API stops. Use a real MongoDB for anything you want to keep.

## Running with a real MongoDB

1. Install MongoDB locally or create a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
2. `cd backend && cp .env.example .env` (already done once) and set `MONGODB_URI` and a long random `JWT_SECRET`.
3. Seed demo data once (optional): `npm run seed` (or `npm run seed -- --reset` to wipe and reseed).
4. `npm run dev`

## Production build

```bash
cd backend && npm run build && npm start      # set NODE_ENV=production, JWT_SECRET, MONGODB_URI
cd frontend && npm run build && npm start     # set API_URL if the API is not on localhost:4000
```

The browser only talks to the Next.js origin; `/api/*` is proxied to the Express API
(`frontend/next.config.ts`), so the session cookie stays first-party and httpOnly.
Uploaded files are stored in `backend/uploads/` (configurable via `UPLOAD_DIR`) and are only
served through the API after a permission check. Back this folder up together with the database.

## How the workflow works

```
Design & confirmation ──(customer approves latest artwork)──▶ Printing ──▶ Stitching ──▶ Finishing ──▶ Ready ──(owner confirms dispatch)──▶ Delivered
```

- The **design team** uploads artwork versions; the **customer** approves or requests changes
  (the owner can record a phone/WhatsApp approval on their behalf; this is audit-logged).
- Each **department** can only complete its own stage; the owner can complete any stage or send a job back for rework.
- **Production roles never see prices.** Customers only ever see their own orders.
- Every critical action (orders, approvals, stage moves, payments, invoices, deliveries, stock, users) is written to the audit log.

## Project layout

```
backend/src
  app.ts                 Express app: security middleware + route mounting
  index.ts / dev-memory.ts   Entry points (real MongoDB / in-memory)

  config/env.ts          Environment configuration
  lib/constants.ts       Roles, stages, product configs, sizes, payment methods
  lib/workflow.ts        Status rules, approval gate, row-level scoping, order serialization
  middleware/            Auth (JWT cookie, role guard) and error handling
  models/                Mongoose schemas
  routes/                auth, users, customers, orders, payments, inventory, dashboard, reports, settings/meta/audit
frontend/src
  app/login              Sign-in
  app/(app)/...          Authenticated pages (dashboard, orders, production, customers, inventory, billing, delivery, reports, users, activity, settings)
  app/invoice/[id]       Printable quotation / invoice
  components/            App shell, auth context, modals, UI primitives
  lib/                   API client, types, formatting helpers
